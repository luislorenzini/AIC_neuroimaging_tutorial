# Resting-state Functional MRI pre-processing: Short Tutorial 

Raw resting-state functional MRI images are prone to a series of artifacts and variability sources. For this reason, before performing our statistical analysis, we need to apply a series of procedures that aim at removing the sources of signal that we are not interested in, to clean the ones we want to study. All these procedures together are called *pre-processing* .
This document will guide you through the basic steps that are usually taken in the rs-fMRI pre-processing phase.
